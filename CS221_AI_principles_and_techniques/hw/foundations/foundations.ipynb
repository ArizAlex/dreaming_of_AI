We can take as many steps forward at a time, but we will never step backwards. How many ways are there to reach the top? Give your answer as a function of $n$. For example: if $n = 3$, then the answer is $4$. The four options are the following: (1) take one step, take one step, take one step (2) take two steps, take one step (3) take one step, take two steps (4) take three steps."
